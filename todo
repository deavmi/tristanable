## Todo

- [ ] Exception handling
    - [ ] If the watcher has an error then we should throw an exception
        * But it has to be on the main thread, therefore it should happen when using any of the `Queue` methods
        * We need to set a value in those methods for this, everything should then throw an exception as the underlying endpoint is dead
        - [x] We must set a field in `Manager` which `Queue` can check and then throw an exception
        - [x] `Queue` must take in the `Manager` instance
        - [x] Add checks in `Queue` class


- [ ] New sys, before calling `continue`, should `yield()`
